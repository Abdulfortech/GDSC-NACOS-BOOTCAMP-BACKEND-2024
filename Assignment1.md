# PHP101 Assignment: Advanced Calculator Class

## Overview

For this assignment, you will extend the `Calculator` class to include methods that utilize a range of PHP's built-in math functions. These methods will perform more advanced mathematical operations.

## Objectives

- Gain familiarity with a wider range of PHP's built-in math functions.
- Continue practicing encapsulating functionality within a class.
- Implement methods for advanced mathematical operations.

## Task

You are required to extend your existing `Calculator` class or create a new one. This class should include the following methods, each utilizing a specific built-in PHP function:

1. **Base Convert**: A method to convert a number between different bases using `base_convert()`.
2. **Logarithm**: A method to calculate the logarithm of a number using `log()`.
3. **Pi Value**: A method to return the value of Ï€ (pi) using `pi()`.
4. **Random Number**: A method to generate a random number using `rand()`.
5. **Round**: A method to round a number to the nearest integer using `round()`.
6. **Sine**: A method to calculate the sine of an angle using `sin()`.
7. **Cosine**: A method to calculate the cosine of an angle using `cos()`.
8. **Tangent**: A method to calculate the tangent of an angle using `tan()`.
9. **Ceiling**: A method to round a number up to the next highest integer using `ceil()`.
10. **Absolute Value**: A method to return the absolute value of a number using `abs()`.
11. **Exponentiation**: A method to calculate the exponential value using `exp()`.
12. **Check NaN**: A method to check if a value is not a number using `is_nan()`.

## Instructions

1. **Extend the Calculator Class**:
   - If you have already created a `Calculator` class, add the new methods to it.
   - If not, create a new `Calculator` class in a PHP file named `AdvancedCalculator.php`.

2. **Implement the Methods**:
   - Implement each of the methods listed above as public methods of the `Calculator` class.
   - Each method should use the relevant built-in PHP function to perform the operation.

3. **Submission**:
   The assignment will be submitted on Friday 6th Sept, 2024.
