# Backend Development Track Overview

## 4. Databases: Relational vs. Non-relational

### A. Relational Databases (SQL)
- **Overview**: Structured data storage in tables with relationships between them.
- **Examples**: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle.
- **Strengths**:
  - ACID compliance (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability).
  - Strong data integrity, complex queries using SQL.
- **Use Cases**: Applications requiring complex transactions, data consistency, and integrity (e.g., banking, e-commerce).

### B. Non-relational Databases (NoSQL)
- **Overview**: Flexible data storage that doesnâ€™t require a fixed schema, designed for scalability and performance.
- **Examples**: MongoDB, Cassandra, Couchbase.
- **Strengths**:
  - Highly scalable, suitable for handling large volumes of unstructured data.
  - Flexible schemas, fast data access for certain types of queries.
- **Use Cases**: Real-time analytics, content management systems, large-scale distributed systems.

### C. Comparing SQL and NoSQL
- **When to Use SQL**:
  - Need for complex joins, ACID transactions, and structured data.
- **When to Use NoSQL**:
  - Large-scale data storage, need for flexibility in data models, and high performance with unstructured data.
