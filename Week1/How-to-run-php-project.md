# How to Run a PHP Project

This guide explains how to run a PHP project using XAMPP on your local machine.


## Step 1: Start XAMPP

1. **Open XAMPP Control Panel**: Find the XAMPP Control Panel on your computer and open it.
2. **Start Apache**: In the XAMPP Control Panel, click the "Start" button next to Apache. This will start the Apache server, which is needed to run PHP files.

## Step 2: Place Your PHP Project in the `htdocs` Directory

1. **Navigate to the `htdocs` Directory**: This directory is where XAMPP serves files from. Typically, it is located in:
   - **Windows**: `C:\xampp\htdocs`
   - **macOS**: `/Applications/XAMPP/htdocs`

2. **Copy Your Project Folder**: Place your PHP project folder inside the `htdocs` directory. For example, if your project is named `my-php-project`, the path should be:
   - **Windows**: `C:\xampp\htdocs\my-php-project`
   - **macOS**: `/Applications/XAMPP/htdocs/my-php-project`

## Step 3: Run Your PHP Project

1. **Open Your Web Browser**: Open any web browser of your choice (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari).
2. **Access Your Project**: In the address bar, type the following URL and press Enter: http://localhost/my-php-project

Replace `my-php-project` with the name of your project folder.

3. **View Your Project**: Your PHP project should now be running, and you will see the output of your `index.php` file or the specified PHP file in the browser.

## Step 4: Working with Different Files

- **Access Different PHP Files**: To run different PHP files within your project, append the filename to the URL. For example, to access a file named `about.php`, use:
